# Elixir Child Specs by Example

Supervisors, children, and when child specs came into play.

## My First Supervisor

Use examples from docs.

## Who Called What? Where?

start_link, init, number of params

## A Child Spec is a Child Spec

You just need a map at the end of the day... or a module... or a tuple

## Closing Remarks

I hope that clears things up.
